## Overview

LevelApp is a specialized platform that combines marketplace functionality with social networking for the gaming community. Unlike generic marketplaces, it allows gamers to showcase their identities, preferences, and collections while facilitating buying, selling, and discussions. Users can chat with fellow gamers, search for products with advanced filters, save items, and receive notifications—all in a gamer-focused environment.

## Client Challenges

Gamers struggle with common marketplaces like eBay, Craigslist, or Mercado Libre, which lack community aspects and are not optimized for gaming needs. These platforms focus solely on transactions, making it hard to build connections, showcase personal gaming identities, or discuss games. This leads to isolated buying/selling experiences and difficulty finding niche gaming items without a dedicated space.
